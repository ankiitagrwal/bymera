 Cardlessa ‚Äî Universal Crypto Payment Solution

Tagline

‚ÄúPay with crypto anywhere ‚Äî even on sites that only accept cards.‚Äù

Cardlessa is a browser extension that enables crypto payments on any website that accepts card payments, even if the merchant doesn‚Äôt support cryptocurrency.

‚∏ª

üí° Problem Statement

Despite massive Web3 growth, crypto payments still face major barriers:
	‚Ä¢	Merchants must integrate complex payment gateways to accept crypto.
	‚Ä¢	Most e-commerce sites still depend solely on card networks.
	‚Ä¢	Users are forced to off-ramp crypto into fiat before paying online.
	‚Ä¢	Integration, compliance, and regulatory friction slow mass adoption.

In short ‚Äî crypto can‚Äôt be used everywhere, even though users already have funds.

‚∏ª

 Our Solution

Cardlessa is a browser extension that acts as a universal crypto payment bridge:
	‚Ä¢	Works on any site that has a card checkout form.
	‚Ä¢	Replaces manual card input with a one-click crypto payment flow.
	‚Ä¢	Generates a virtual card in the background, funded by crypto.
	‚Ä¢	Enables privacy-first and merchant-agnostic payments.

Result: Any e-commerce or subscription site instantly becomes crypto-compatible ‚Äî without the merchant ever integrating Web3.

‚∏ª

 How It Works
	1.	The browser extension automatically detects card payment forms.
	2.	It injects a wallet connector that allows crypto payment directly.
	3.	The backend and smart contract convert crypto ‚Üí fiat and fund a virtual card via Lithic API.
	4.	The card details are auto-filled, and the merchant processes payment as a normal card transaction.

‚úÖ No merchant integration needed
‚úÖ Instant crypto-to-card conversion
‚úÖ Complete privacy and security
