> Universal Crypto Payment Solution

**"Pay with crypto anywhere — even on sites that only accept cards."**

Vymera is a browser extension that enables crypto payments on any website that accepts card payments, even if the merchant doesn't support cryptocurrency.

## Problem Statement

Despite massive Web3 growth, crypto payments still face major barriers:

- **Merchants** must integrate complex payment gateways to accept crypto
- **Most e-commerce sites** still depend solely on card networks
- **Users** are forced to off-ramp crypto into fiat before paying online
- **Integration, compliance, and regulatory friction** slow mass adoption

**In short** — crypto can't be used everywhere, even though users already have funds.

## Our Solution

Vymera is a browser extension that acts as a universal crypto payment bridge:

- Works on **any site** that has a card checkout form
- Replaces manual card input with a **one-click crypto payment flow**
- Generates a **virtual card** in the background, funded by crypto
- Enables **privacy-first** and merchant-agnostic payments

**Result:** Any e-commerce or subscription site instantly becomes crypto-compatible — without the merchant ever integrating Web3.

## How It Works

1. **Detection** — The browser extension automatically detects card payment forms
2. **Injection** — It injects a wallet connector that allows crypto payment directly
3. **Conversion** — The backend and smart contract convert crypto → fiat and fund a virtual card via Lithic API
4. **Processing** — The card details are auto-filled, and the merchant processes payment as a normal card transaction

### Benefits

-  **No merchant integration needed**
-  **Instant crypto-to-card conversion**
-  **Complete privacy and security**
